# Metaphorix

A chat application that allows for users to create a one-on-one chat with any other existing user, alternatively the user can create a group chat with multiple people.
Messages include the time of when it was sent. 

The project has been fully written in Java. The server side uses the Spring Boot Framework to handle http messages, and the UI has been built using JavaFX's SceneBuilder. Furthermore, the styling of the UI has been done using CSS. 

The motivation for this project was to build something using Java and Spring to get more familiar with the Spring Framework while building experience with Java.
